# Spreadsheet to Scala

## Outline

Read a spreadsheet, and for some specified set of cells...

- convert cell formulas to functions.
- convert cells without formulas to constants.
- convert the current value of a formula in the spreadsheet to a unit test.

### Example

Given a spreadsheet like this:

```
  +----- A ----
1 |          11
2 |          13
3 | =SUM(A1,A2)
```

...it should be converted to something along the lines of this:

```
lazy val cellA1 = 11
lazy val cellA2 = 13
def cellA3(x: Int, y: Int) = x + y
asssert( cellA3(cellA1,cellA2) === 24 )
```

## Approach

 - Parse a formula into a tree
 - Chase references and include them
 - Generate code

## Challenges

- Excel formula syntax not uniform
- Functions take values, arrays, ranges...
- Differences between Scala and Excel formula behaviour
- Cyclic referencesËœ
- Infering/converting types
- References across worksheets
- How does Excel treat dates and timezones?
- What are array formula?
- The cached value for a formula could be stale.
- Spreadsheets other than Excel
- ...

We'll do some simple things, and see what cases present themselves.

# Current Status

Does almost nothing:

```
$ sbt run
[info] Running s2s.Main
FormulaCell(SUM(A1,A2),NumericCell(24.0))
Parsing SUM(A1,A2) ...
Success(Func(SUM,CellRef(A1),CellRef(A2)))
```
